# Hive Helsinki Game Jam

2022 end of january I was participating on Hive Helsinki The Coding School's very first game jam, where we had 48h to make a game.

I choosed Unity program to make this game and pre-made assets.

Earlier already made few games, but since that time I felt forget things so it was a very good event to refresh my memory a bit.

The idea what with my team we wanted to achieve was a small platformer, because we like the pixel retro platformer games.

It was pretty challenging as Unity after few restart behaved a bit unexpectedly, but once we had a level bit AI enemies and cool movement animations, it was very rewarding to play this small game.

    Unity version: 2020.3.25f1

Here is a small gif from the demo gameplay:
